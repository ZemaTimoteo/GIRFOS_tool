  - To run:
      - Set your path
      - Add the following tools to the Tool folder:
          - bart - https://mrirecon.github.io/bart/
          - Gridding - https://github.com/ndwork/griddingCodes
      - As an exemple choose file '.dat' in /Example folder
            - 'dat_file' folder contains the '.dat' file in three parts
            - use https://pinetools.com/join-files to join the three files
            - copy that file to the path: 'GIRFOS_tool/Matlab_basedCode/Example/test64_GIRF_tX-1_tY-1_Npulses-12_Nreps-3_Nslices-1_TR-2s_sm-115_RFbw-1_RFoff-         
                                              50mm_tPulTotal-10ms/'
            - when running the script, select the '.dat' file you copy to the path in the last step.                                              
  
Folder: Spiral
  - pypulseqSPIRAL_seqRecon.m - Obtain external gradients in matlab matrix from pypulseq sequence
  - recon_spiral_IRF.m - Reconstruct Spiral with GIRF
  - recon_spiral_IRF_both_IRF_THEOR.m - Run for each test of SCAN the reconstruction with Theoric ktraj and GIRF ktraj
  
  - To run 'recon_spiral_IRF.m':
      - Set your path
      - Add the following tools to the Tool folder:
          - bart - https://mrirecon.github.io/bart/
          - Gridding - https://github.com/ndwork/griddingCodes
      - As an exemple choose file Spiral '.dat' in /Example folder
            - 'Spiral_dat_file' folder contains the '.dat' file in three parts
            - use https://pinetools.com/join-files to join the three files
            - copy that file to the path: 'GIRFOS_tool/Matlab_basedCode/Example/test84_Spiraltest4_Nreps-4_Nslices-1_TR-2s_TE-0ms_sm-125_RFbw-1_RFoff-0mm_Ndirs-

            - when running the script, select the '.dat' file you copy to the path in the last step.
  
  - To run 'recon_spiral_IRF_both_IRF_THEOR.m':
      - Set your path
      - Add the following tools to the Tool folder:
          - bart - https://mrirecon.github.io/bart/
          - Gridding - https://github.com/ndwork/griddingCodes
      - As an exemple choose file Spiral '.dat' in /Example folder
            - 'Spiral_dat_file' folder contains the '.dat' file in three parts
            - use https://pinetools.com/join-files to join the three files
            - copy that file to the path: 'GIRFOS_tool/Matlab_basedCode/Example/test84_Spiraltest4_Nreps-4_Nslices-1_TR-2s_TE-0ms_sm-125_RFbw-1_RFoff-0mm_Ndirs-
