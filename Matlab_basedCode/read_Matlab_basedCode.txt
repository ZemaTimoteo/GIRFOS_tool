This file helps describing Matlab_based Code.

Folder: GIRF
  - get_GIRF.m (Saves the GIRF from scanner of the respective GIRF sequence from pypulseq.seq )
  
  - To run:
      - Set your path
      - Add the following tools to the Tool folder:
          - bart - https://mrirecon.github.io/bart/
          - Gridding - https://github.com/ndwork/griddingCodes
      - As an exemple choose file '.dat' in /exemple folder
      - run with your on '.dat' file

  - Input_sequences (Folder)
  - mapVBVD (toolbox from https://github.com/CIC-methods/FID-A/tree/master/inputOutput/mapVBVD)
  - pulses (Folder)
  - GIRF_shape_script.m (Generate TrianglePulse in '.mat' file, for generate with external gradients a '.seq' file w/ 'test_GIRF_SEQfile.py')
  - sharp_imProfile.m (his function returns a struct 'bound' which contains the bourders of distinct regions for a imProfile matlab function)
  - gradient_create_GIRF.m (function adapted from: https://github.com/mriphysics/verse-mb/tree/master/bin)
  - gradient_distort_GIRF.m (function adapted from: https://github.com/mriphysics/verse-mb/tree/master/bin)

* To run this create a folder with the following toolboxes:
  - code from pypulseq - https://github.com/imr-framework/pypulseq
  - code from pulseqDiffusion - https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/2478  
  
  Also you need to install JEMRIS to run
